# LeetChain

## Overview

LeetChain is an experimental blockchain implementation where transactions consist of LeetCode questions and their corresponding answers.
This project aims to explore blockchain technology while leveraging EC keys for wallet management and utilizing ROCKSDB for data persistence.

## Motivation

The primary goals of LeetChain are:

- **Understanding Blockchain**: Gain a deeper understanding of blockchain technology by implementing a simplified version.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Apply theoretical blockchain knowledge to a practical project involving real-world(ish) data and cryptography.
- **Educational Purpose**: Create a learning tool that combines blockchain concepts with coding challenges from LeetCode, using EC keys for secure wallet management and ROCKSDB for efficient data storage.

## Features

- **Block Structure**: Each block contains a set of transactions (LeetCode questions and answers).
- **Proof of Work**: Implementing a basic Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm for block validation.
- **Decentralized Ledger**: Simulate a decentralized ledger where each node can add new blocks to the chain.
- **EC Keys for Wallets**: Utilize Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography for secure wallet management, allowing users to sign transactions with their private keys.
- **ROCKSDB Persistence**: Use ROCKSDB for efficient and reliable data persistence, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of the blockchain data.

This project combines practical blockchain implementation with cryptographic security and efficient data handling, aiming to provide a comprehensive learning experience in blockchain technology.
