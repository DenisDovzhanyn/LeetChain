# LeetChain

## Overview

The LeetChain project is an experimental blockchain implementation where transactions consist of LeetCode questions and their corresponding answers. This project aims to explore blockchain technology while utilizing familiar content from LeetCode to create a unique learning experience.
## Motivation

The primary goals of this project are:
- **Understanding Blockchain**: Gain a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology works by implementing a simplified version.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Apply theoretical blockchain knowledge to a practical project involving real-world(ish) data.
- **Educational Purpose**: Create a learning tool that combines the concepts of blockchain with coding challenges from LeetCode.

## Features

- **Block Structure**: Each block contains a set of transactions (LeetCode questions and answers).
- **Proof of Work**: Implementing a basic Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm for block validation.
- **Decentralized Ledger**: Simulate a decentralized ledger where each node can add new blocks to the chain.
Persistence: Data persistence using files or a database.
